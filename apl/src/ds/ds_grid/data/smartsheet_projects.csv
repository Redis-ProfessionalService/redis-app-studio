Hi Al, how are you doing ? I am Kevin Wjeux, CSR in EMEA,  I had a quick chat with Brad regarding one potential customer. They will need  training on Redis data types, etc for developers.

Now instead of selling them a developer training, Brad Snider  suggested to increase their ARR by 5k and ask for your help to train them. They need to train 15 developers.

I would suggest changing the terminology for what they are looking for and let's call it a Developer Workshop and have it spread over two (two hour sessions - making it four hours total).  I will need to speak with them before I can share a Workshop Agenda - we can cover Redis core topics and/or one or two modules - they need to decide.",,955324697208708
