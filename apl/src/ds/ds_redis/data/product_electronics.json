When Preston Blake (Harve Presnell), a remarkably wealthy media magnate, dies with neither a wife nor children, the question on the lips of most of his associates is who will inherit the estate. The surprising answer turns out to be Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), a cheerful but half-bright proprietor of a small-town pizzeria, as well as part-time greeting card poet, who was a distant relative of Blake. In order to claim his 40-billion-dollar inheritance, Deeds heads to New York City, where Blake's former associates, Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) and Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari), introduce him to the city while trying to figure out how to get their hands on his new fortune. Meanwhile, Mac McGrath (Jared Harris), the producer of a sleazy tabloid television show, wants to get the inside scoop on Deeds, and comes up with perfect way to get it: he sends beautiful but unscrupulous reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder) to sweep Deeds off his feet while she's wired for sound. Convincing Deeds that she's from a small town just like himself, Bennett quickly wins his heart, but while his affection is sincere, hers is not. He also displays a curious eagerness to defend her good name with his fists which quickly gets him in trouble. Meanwhile, as Deeds becomes the new laughing stock of New York thanks to Bennett's stories, Deeds decides it's time he did something big with his money, while Cedar and Anderson think they've finally found a way to take control of Deeds' holdings. Mr. Deeds also features supporting performances from John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Conchata Ferrell. John McEnroe and Rev.

On the surface, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss (David Hasselhoff), Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and two picture-perfect children, Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann), has grown increasingly difficult.

It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. As Michael discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember.","longDescriptionHtml":"Mr. Deeds One of Frank Capra's best-loved stories gets a modernized and wildly slapstick reinterpretation in this romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler.

When she starts working in Flipper's Manhattan office, one day they look at each other and are soon having sex over a blueprint-strewn desk. Their liaison causes an explosion on both homefronts. Flipper's family consists of his father Doctor Purify (Ossie Davis), a former preacher; his mother Lucinda (Ruby Dee); his violent, crackhead brother Gator (Samuel L.

The clean, colorful visuals create a mood of intimate tangibility, the audio gives a most deserving representation of the entire concert, and Buckley's vocals slam into an unsuspecting listener/viewer with flaring passion. All 13 performances can be selected from the \"Set List\" menu. The \"Discography\" feature is a stills gallery of four album covers, with song titles listed to the side. The bonus acoustic songs, from a videotaped sit-down affair, are a slightly awkward attempt at an Unplugged atmosphere, but even when Buckley isn't in top form, his voice remains powerfully stunning. \"The Electronic Press,\" a glossily produced, 17-minute mini-documentary, from the Grace period is the best special feature here. It is a genuinely enlightening and remarkably moving glimpse into Buckley's inspiration and art. Like his father before him, Jeff Buckley was a true talent who died with much music left to bestow. This live performance DVD is a most welcome, respectful ode to a gifted artist.","longDescriptionHtml":"Jeff Buckley was known for his soaring vocal range and his searing, emotional songs and performances.

All 13 performances can be selected from the \"Set List\" menu. The \"Discography\" feature is a stills gallery of four album covers, with song titles listed to the side. The bonus acoustic songs, from a videotaped sit-down affair, are a slightly awkward attempt at an Unplugged atmosphere, but even when Buckley isn't in top form, his voice remains powerfully stunning. \"The Electronic Press,\" a glossily produced, 17-minute mini-documentary, from the Grace period is the best special feature here. It is a genuinely enlightening and remarkably moving glimpse into Buckley's inspiration and art. Like his father before him, Jeff Buckley was a true talent who died with much music left to bestow. This live performance DVD is a most welcome, respectful ode to a gifted artist.","cast":[{"name":"Michael Tighe","role":"Guitar"}],"crew":[],"details":[{"name":"Language","value":"English","values":["English"]},{"name":"Program Type","value":"OneTimeOnly","values":["OneTimeOnly"]},{"name":"Studio","value":"Sony","values":["Sony"]},{"name":"Region Code","value":"1","values":["1"]},{"name":"Sound Features","value":"Dolby Digital w/ sub-woofer channel","values":["Dolby Digital w/ sub-woofer channel","stereo"]},{"name":"Format","value":"DVD","values":["DVD"]},{"name":"Product Name","value":"Jeff Buckley: Live in Chicago [DVD] [1995]","values":["Jeff Buckley: Live in Chicago [DVD] [1995]"]},{"name":"Product Tags","value":"DVD","values":["DVD"]}],"includedItemList":[],"features":[],"offers":[],"marketplace":false,"listingId":null,"sellerId":null,"shippingRestrictions":null,"discs":[],"commerceSku":3964696,"haulawayAvailable":null,"proposition65WarningMessage":null,"proposition65WarningType":"05"}

Set in a Shanghaiese enclave in Hong Kong in 1962, the film centers on two young couples who rent adjacent rooms in a cramped and crowded tenement. Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) works as a secretary in an export company while her husband's job at a Japanese multinational keeps him away on extended business trips. Across the hall, Chow (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) works as a newspaper editor and is married to a woman who is also frequently out of town. Neither respective spouse is ever shown in full, instead they are shot from the back or obscured by walls and furniture. Li-zhen and Chow soon strike up a cordial -- if tenative -- friendship. Chow begins to suspect that his wife's long absences are not entirely business related when he stops in unannounced at her office to discover that she is not there. Later, a colleague tells him that he saw his wife with another man. The icing on the cake comes when Chow notices that Li-zhen's handbag is identical to his wife's while Li-zhen discovers that Chow is wearing a tie that she gave her husband; it doesn't take long for them to realize that their spouses are sleeping together. Drawn together by shame and anger, Chow and Li-zhen reveal nothing of their discoveries to their partners. While working through their guilt by imagining how their adulterous spouses first hooked up and rehearsing interrogations, the pair slowly fall in love in spite of their determination to uphold their end of their marital vows. In the Mood for Love, which was screened in competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, barely made it to the fest's final slot; Wong Kar-wai was reportedly shooting scenes in Cambodia a week prior to the festival.~Jonathan Crow","plotHtml":"For his first film since the 1997 Hong Kong handover, auteur filmmaker Wong Kar-wai directs this moody period drama about unrequited love that, like his earlier work, swoons with romantic melancholy.

The two-disc set is definitive in many ways, although it does not contain a director's commentary track. Nevertheless, this is by far the most complete and fascinating DVD treatment given to a Wong Kar-Wai film. Disc one presents the film in a stunning new digital letterboxed transfer (1.66:1 enhanced) with a Dolby Digital 5.0 soundtrack in its original Cantonese and Shanghainese with optional English subtitles. The picture is luminous, sharp, and beautifully clear, perfectly showing off Christopher Doyle's and Mark Li Ping-Bin's memorable cinematography. Also available on the disc are numerous deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a separate music-only track that highlights Michael Galasso's unforgettable score, and an early short film by Wong Kar-Wai. Disc two contains the meat of the supplemental material, of course. The major extra is a consistently fascinating documentary on all aspects of the film's production -- from the earliest stages of pre-production to the final result -- and should more than reward up-and-coming filmmakers as well as people with only a casual interest in what goes on behind the cameras. Also included is an interesting interview with the director, interviews with stars Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung from their Toronto International Film Festival press conference, trailers, electronic press skits, essays, and much more.","longDescriptionHtml":"One of the most highly acclaimed films of 2000, Wong Kar-Wai's stylish romantic drama In the Mood for Love is given the Criterion Collection treatment, giving viewers hours of sublime pleasure.
