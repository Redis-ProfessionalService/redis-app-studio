Both Electronic Lover and The Spy Who Came have been transferred to disc in their original full-frame aspect ratios of 1.33:1, and both films look fine on DVD. While the source print for The Spy Who Came suffers some wear at the end of reels, for the most part it's clean and looks as good as one might hope, while the elements for Electronic Lover are admirably clean, and the film's moody camerawork is well served on disc. Both movies are in English, with no multiple language options or subtitles, and the audio has been mastered in Dolby Digital Stereo, retaining the original monophonic sound mixes for these movies. The low-budget sound recording for The Spy Who Came suffers a bit in this presentation, but Electronic Lover fares better, especially the enjoyably out-dated rock music score from the Fludd. Plenty of bonus materials have been appended to this disc, including four sexploitation trailers, a mid-'50s strip reel (Girl of My Dreams), a oddball burlesque short (Tel-Star Striptease), and an outdated educational short, The Philosophy of Computing. A gallery of film-oriented men's magazine artwork rounds out the package.

Stranger: Bernie Worrell on Earth has been given a non-anamorphic letterboxed transfer to disc, framed in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78:1, and the new material generally looks very good, though some of the performance footage suggests the filmmakers had only limited access to Worrell's live shows and some of the aging footage of the P-Funk tours of the Seventies clearly needs restoration. The audio appears in two mixes, in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and two-channel Dolby Stereo, and is crisp and resonant in both formats, making the most of Worrell's layers of eccentric keyboard patterns. The interviews are in English, with no subtitles or multiple language options included. As a bonus, the disc includes additional interview material with a dozen of the musicians who appear in the films (the bonus interviews actually run longer than the documentary itself), as well as footage of Worrell in the studio, recording two improvised pieces for his 2007 album Improvisczario. If this is hardly the definitive portrait of a wildly under-appreciated artist, at very least Stranger: Bernie Worrell on Earth offers a thoughtful look at his life and work, and music fans will want to give it a look.",,VIDEO/COMPACT DISC,

Season Two of House begins as the gloriously obnoxious and abrasive Dr. Gregory House, head nephrologist at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, stubbornly (and somewhat perversely) trying to save the life of a seriously ill death-row inmate over the objections of his colleagues. Perhaps House is being more contrary than usual because he doesn't like being forced to work in close quarters with his ex-girlfriend Stacy (Sela Ward). Elsewhere, House's colleague Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) is herself faced with a life-or-death crisis when evidence indicates that she is HIV-positive; House's superior-in-name-only Dr. Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) clashes with him over the treatment of a man who suffered an injury while working on Cuddy's roof; neurologist Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) briefly becomes House's boss, with both men pushing the envelope to see which one will go ballistic first; and after separating from his wife, oncologist James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) moves in with House--who despite his anger over having to share his space with anyone is reluctant to let Wilson leave because the guy is such a great cook! And in the two-part episode ""Euphoria"", House races against time to determine the malady that is causing a wounded policeman to literally laugh himself to death--things getting uncomfortably personal when Foreman begins showing the same symptions! The second ends when House is shot and wounded by the husband of a former patient--and those fans aware of the series' many references to Sherlock Holmes will get a kick out of the name of the assailant. Among the honors bestowed upon House during its second season on the air was the prestigious Peabody Award for ""Best of Electronic Media.""",,VIDEO/COMPACT DISC,

When Preston Blake (Harve Presnell), a remarkably wealthy media magnate, dies with neither a wife nor children, the question on the lips of most of his associates is who will inherit the estate. The surprising answer turns out to be Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), a cheerful but half-bright proprietor of a small-town pizzeria, as well as part-time greeting card poet, who was a distant relative of Blake. In order to claim his 40-billion-dollar inheritance, Deeds heads to New York City, where Blake's former associates, Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) and Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari), introduce him to the city while trying to figure out how to get their hands on his new fortune. Meanwhile, Mac McGrath (Jared Harris), the producer of a sleazy tabloid television show, wants to get the inside scoop on Deeds, and comes up with perfect way to get it: he sends beautiful but unscrupulous reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder) to sweep Deeds off his feet while she's wired for sound. Convincing Deeds that she's from a small town just like himself, Bennett quickly wins his heart, but while his affection is sincere, hers is not. He also displays a curious eagerness to defend her good name with his fists which quickly gets him in trouble. Meanwhile, as Deeds becomes the new laughing stock of New York thanks to Bennett's stories, Deeds decides it's time he did something big with his money, while Cedar and Anderson think they've finally found a way to take control of Deeds' holdings. Mr. Deeds also features supporting performances from John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Conchata Ferrell. John McEnroe and Rev. Al Sharpton make cameo appearances as themselves.&#13;&#13;Click A workaholic architect, frustrated in his job but determined to make a better life for his family, is bestowed with a powerful universal remote that allows him more control over his life than he ever knew possible in director Frank Coraci's high-concept fantasy comedy. On the surface, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss (David Hasselhoff), Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and two picture-perfect children, Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann), has grown increasingly difficult. When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads the overworked husband and father to a nearby Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote with the power to control all of his electronic devices, a curious peek into the back room leads Michael into the company of eccentric employee and talented inventor Morty (Christopher Walken). It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. As Michael discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember.",,VIDEO/COMPACT DISC,

The bonus acoustic songs, from a videotaped sit-down affair, are a slightly awkward attempt at an Unplugged atmosphere, but even when Buckley isn't in top form, his voice remains powerfully stunning. ""The Electronic Press,"" a glossily produced, 17-minute mini-documentary, from the Grace period is the best special feature here.

4511228,In the Mood For Love [2 Discs] [Criterion Collection] [DVD] [2000],Movie,Oct-19-2019 07:16:57,29.99,,"One of the most highly acclaimed films of 2000, Wong Kar-Wai's stylish romantic drama In the Mood for Love is given the Criterion Collection treatment, giving viewers hours of sublime pleasure. The two-disc set is definitive in many ways, although it does not contain a director's commentary track. Nevertheless, this is by far the most complete and fascinating DVD treatment given to a Wong Kar-Wai film. Disc one presents the film in a stunning new digital letterboxed transfer (1.66:1 enhanced) with a Dolby Digital 5.0 soundtrack in its original Cantonese and Shanghainese with optional English subtitles. The picture is luminous, sharp, and beautifully clear, perfectly showing off Christopher Doyle's and Mark Li Ping-Bin's memorable cinematography. Also available on the disc are numerous deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a separate music-only track that highlights Michael Galasso's unforgettable score, and an early short film by Wong Kar-Wai. Disc two contains the meat of the supplemental material, of course. The major extra is a consistently fascinating documentary on all aspects of the film's production -- from the earliest stages of pre-production to the final result -- and should more than reward up-and-coming filmmakers as well as people with only a casual interest in what goes on behind the cameras. Also included is an interesting interview with the director, interviews with stars Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung from their Toronto International Film Festival press conference, trailers, electronic press skits, essays, and much more.",,VIDEO/COMPACT DISC,
