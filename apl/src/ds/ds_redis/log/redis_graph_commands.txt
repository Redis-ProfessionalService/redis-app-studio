No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the publics consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brandos 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracys reputation hasnt dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando.

Both of his parents were originally from Oklahoma. Harris grew up as the middle child. After graduating high school, he attended New Yorks Columbia University, where he played football. After viewing local theater productions, Harris took a sudden interest in acting. He left Columbia, headed to Oklahoma, where his parents were living, and enrolled in the University of Oklahomas theater department. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to find work. He started acting in theater and television guest spots. Harris landed his first leading role in a film in cult-favorite George A. Romeros Knightriders (1981). Two years later, he got his first taste of critical acclaim, playing astronaut John Glenn in The Right Stuff (1983). Also that year, he made his New York stage debut in Sam Shepards Fool for Love, a performance that earned him an Obie for Outstanding Actor. Harris career gathered momentum after that. In 2000, he made his debut as a director in the Oscar-winning film Pollock (2000).',principal_birth_year:1950,principal_professions:'actor|producer|soundtrack',principal_is_male:true,principal_height:70,principal_eye_color:'Blue'}),(:Principal {common_id:'nm0000599',common_name:'Kathleen Quinlan',common_summary:'Kathleen Quinlan was born in Pasadena, California, the only child of Josephine (Zachry), a military-supply supervisor, and Robert Quinlan, a television sports director.
